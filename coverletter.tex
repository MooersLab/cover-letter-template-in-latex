RE: manuscript submission \\

Dear Editor,\\

Please find attached the enclosed paper titled \emph{} as part of the Education track.
We have developed these tips without assistance from chatbots, so the tips are original with us.
Some tips may be relatively obvious to some readers, but others are not so obvious.
However, we did use coding assistants to develop some of the code that we mentioned in the paper.
We also include links to our software on GitHub and Zenodo that users can utilize to enhance their Emacs learning journey.
We think this paper will be of broad interest because the tips can be translated to other programming languages and coding assistants.

This paper has not been submitted to any other journal.
We have supplied a list of potential reviewers.

\vskip 1em
{Best regards,} \\
